NMSMExp Notes
=============

This documentation is intended to serve as a running set of notes on numerical
methods for stochastic modeling.

The NMSMExp project is under construction and at release 0.1. 

We can cite a paper, like [Nguyen2009]_, which will typically be shown at the
bottom of the page. We can reference other parts of the Sphinx project, like
linking to our :doc:`tutorial/index`.
