NMSMExp Notes
=============

This documentation is intended to serve as a running set of notes on numerical
methods for stochastic modeling.

The NMSMExp project is under construction and at version 0.2. I will continue to update it periodically with the goal of releasing it as an open-source textbook with working code at version 1.0.

References used in the creation of the notes are listed below, like [boyd2004convex]_.
